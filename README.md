Title: Heart Attack Prediction using AI and Telegram Channel integrated with ambulatory System
Abstract:  Clinical decision support systems frequently employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to accurately forecast and diagnose a variety of diseases.
Due to their capacity to uncover hidden patterns and connections in the medical data supplied by medical practitioners, these classification algorithms are particularly effective in creating clinical 
support systems.
Given that heart disease is one of the top causes of mortality worldwide, diagnosing heart disease is one of the most crucial purposes for such systems.  
Almost all systems that forecast cardiac diseases use clinical datasets that contain parameters and inputs from intricate lab procedures. None of the algorithms can predict heart illnesses 
with age, family history, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity or physical inactivity as risk factors etc., Many of the apparent risk 
indicators that can be used to diagnose heart diseases are shared by those who have them. 
A system based on such risk factors would benefit medical professionals as well as patients by alerting them to the potential for heart disease before they enter a hospital or undergo 
pricey diagnostic tests. 
So, using several AI enabled Classifying Algorithms, this paper proposes a method for predicting heart disease using key risk indicators. This method uses 
the Support Vector, k-NN classifiers, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms, which are widely used classification techniques.
